# `types`

These are draft types for various modules which lack them. They are intended to
by suitable for sending upstream to DefinitelyTyped, once complete.

Note that the declarations here are each wrapped in `declare module`, while
those on DefinitelyTyped are not. `declare module` definitions are easier to
work with in local declarations. They should be unwrapped before submission.
